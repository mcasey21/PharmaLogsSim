This project simulates and focuses on improving quality assurance processes within a pharmaceutical company's 
manufacturing operations through IT solutions. 
This project is a showcase of my knowledge of algorithms and big O notation and C

There are four main tasks to this project:
- Task 1: Sort line logs by date & time and prepare reports sorted by product ID, issue code, date, 
        and time, with a target running time of O(NLog(N)) or better.
- Task 2: Generate reports using a single list to report issue codes by product ID and line ID 
        for all lines, aiming for a running time of O(N) or better.
- Task 3: Develop a search facility to find the earliest occurrence of an issue code for a given 
        product ID across all lines, with a running time of O(Log(N)) or better.
- Task 4: To produce a report summarizing the number of issues reported for a product 
        across all lines, with a running time of O(N) or better.
